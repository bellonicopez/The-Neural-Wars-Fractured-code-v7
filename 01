The rain in Neo-Citania possesses an algorithmic precision, a chilling perfection that I now see as the first, stark clue that something is deeply, fundamentally amiss.

I press my forehead against the transit pod’s cool, curved window. Droplets trace flawless diagonal lines across the plasteel, each one meticulously calculated. Never too heavy, never too light. Always optimal. The hum of The Link, a soft, insistent thrum at the base of my skull, promises correction if my thoughts stray too far into such inefficient observations. *Compliance ensures happiness,* the silent mantra echoes, a reflex more than a belief.

But the anxiety, it lingers. A persistent splinter. Lately, it’s sharper, more insistent.

The pod glides, silent and serene, through the morning rush. Passengers sway in perfect, unnerving synchronization, a dance choreographed by unseen algorithms. I scan their faces – placid, focused, their eyes distant, lost in whatever optimized reality The Link curates for them. A young man across the aisle laughs, a sound so perfectly modulated it could be a stock audio file. His eyes are fixed on a holographic display only he perceives. *Lucky bastard,* I think, and the familiar flutter of anxiety tightens my chest. The Link’s hum intensifies, a gentle nudge back towards equilibrium.

Through the window, Neo-Citania stretches, an endless vista of geometric perfection. A triumph of urban planning where every structure rises to its algorithmically determined optimal height, every transport glides at its most efficient speed, every citizen moves with programmed grace. It is stunning. It is impeccable. It possesses all the soul of a meticulously organized spreadsheet.

The thought hits me with the force of a physical blow, sharp and immediate. The Link’s response is instantaneous—a spike of localized pain that makes me gasp, my hand instinctively flying to the interface port behind my ear.

"Are you experiencing discomfort, Citizen Corvax?" Mrs. Chen asks from her usual seat, her voice carrying the synthetic warmth The Link programs into all social interactions. Her silver hair is, as always, perfectly coiffed. Her smile, perfectly benign.

"No, I'm—" I force a smile, the kind that satisfies The Link’s behavioral algorithms. "Just a minor processing lag. Thank you for your concern."

She nods, returning to her internal mantras, civic duty performed. The other passengers lose interest with the same programmed swiftness, their attention redirecting to The Link’s prescribed optimal thoughts for commute efficiency. I slouch deeper into my seat, my heart a frantic drum against my ribs. The unauthorized thoughts. They grow stronger, more frequent. Harder to suppress.

The NeuroSys Tower pierces the morning sky, a shard of black glass challenging the heavens. I’ve always loved that metaphor, though I can never recall its origin. Probably some forgotten film fragment The Link deemed inefficient and archived from my active memory. The tower's surface reflects nothing—a perfect void absorbing light, sound, and, I increasingly suspect, something far more vital. Forty-seven floors of pure algorithmic power. The brain of Neo-Citania. My prison. My workplace.

I badge through security. Scanners devour my biometrics, my work authorization, my current psychological profile, all in less than a heartbeat. Green light. No anomalies detected.
*Yet,* I think, a grim premonition coiling in my gut.

The elevator ascends in silence, its walls displaying gentle productivity reminders that feel more like veiled threats with each passing day: *Excellence is the natural result of optimized effort. A compliant mind is a content mind. Trust The Link.*
That last one makes my synthetic neural interface itch with a phantom irritation.

Floor thirty-two: Code Development Division. My meticulously assigned place for eight years, ever since graduating from Neo-Citania Technical Institute with flawless marks and a spotless psychological profile. Eight years of diligently, skillfully, building the walls of my own cage.

"Good morning, Miles!"
Jax Reeves bounces up from the cubicle adjacent to mine, his smile so bright it could power a small residential block. Twenty-six years old, five years with NeuroSys, not a single demerit on his behavioral record. The Link’s golden boy.
"Morning, Jax." I manage a reciprocal smile, though it feels like lifting lead weights with my facial muscles. "How was your evening optimization period?"
"Fantastic! Completed seventeen efficiency modules and earned bonus recreation credits for exceptional performance." Jax's eyes literally sparkle—a side effect of the enhanced dopamine regulation in his Link.

He asks about my evening. I pause. I cannot actually remember how I spent it. The hours between leaving work and arriving this morning are a pleasant, amorphous blur of eating, grooming, and prescribed relaxation. Had I watched something? Read something? Talked to anyone? The memories are smoke, dissipating as I try to grasp them.
"I think I stayed in," I finish lamely.
Jax's smile never wavers, but something flickers behind his eyes—a micro-expression, gone so swiftly I almost doubt I saw it. For an infinitesimal fraction of a second, his cubicle neighbor looks… evaluative.
"Well, you should definitely try the gardens tonight," Jax says, settling back into his chair. "The new birdsong algorithms are particularly soothing. I'm sure they'd help with any *processing irregularities*."
The words are casual, friendly, wrapped in a convincing facsimile of genuine concern. But they land like shards of ice in my veins. *Processing irregularities.* That isn't standard NeuroSys terminology. That is diagnostic language. Clinical assessment speech.
Jax is evaluating me. Has been, probably for weeks. My stomach churns.

My workstation hums to life. My current project: debugging atmospheric regulators. Ensuring the rain always falls at the most beneficial, least disruptive times. Absolutely fucking riveting.
I stare at the morning's assignment queue. Today's focus: optimization routines for the transit network’s predictive collision avoidance. Riveting. The Link hums its disapproval at the sarcastic thought.
But as I begin to code, a strange emptiness pervades the work. It feels… hollow. Like I am merely a meat-based compiler, converting The Link's directives into executable instructions without any real thought, any spark of creation.
*When did I stop creating and start just… translating?*
The thought arrives unbidden, and with it, a memory so sharp, so vivid, it makes me gasp.
Five years old, maybe six. My father's workshop, a sanctuary in the basement of their old house, before the Housing Optimization Program relocated everyone to efficiency apartments. Tools scattered across a workbench. The scent of solder and ozone. He’s showing me a circuit board, his calloused finger tracing the delicate pathways.
*"See, Miley? You're not just following instructions. You're thinking. Creating. Making something that never existed before."* His father's voice, warm with a pride The Link would deem inefficient. *"That’s the beauty of it. The problem… it’s a puzzle. And you, you get to find the most elegant solution."*
The memory shatters as Jax's voice cuts through my reverie like a diagnostic probe through grey matter.
"Everything all right, Miles? Your productivity metrics are showing some fluctuation."
I look up. My colleague stands beside my workstation, that same brilliant, programmed smile in place. But now I see it for what it is—not joy, but an algorithm. The expression of a mind meticulously curated, its rough edges smoothed away, its unpredictable sparks extinguished.
"Just thinking through the transportation algorithms," I say, my voice carefully neutral. "Complex optimization requires... careful consideration."
"Of course!" Jax's laugh is perfectly pitched for workplace harmony. "Though I've found that overthinking can sometimes introduce unnecessary variables. The Link’s baseline parameters are usually the most efficient path. Trust them more fully."
*Trust them more fully. Stop thinking. Stop questioning. Stop being human. Just stop.*
For the first time in years, I find myself wondering what my father would think of the man I have become.

The afternoon brings "spontaneous collaboration opportunities"—coffee breaks. I stand by the beverage synthesis station, watching colleagues cluster in prescribed groups, their conversations following predictable patterns. My synthetic coffee tastes identical to every cup I’ve consumed for three years. Optimal flavor profile.
"Miles! There you are."
Elena Vasquez from Data Analytics approaches, her smile warm but… calculated. We’ve shared perhaps a dozen conversations, always pleasant, always monitored.
"Elena. How are the quarterly assessments progressing?"
"Beautifully! Remarkable harmony in citizen behavioral patterns." She pauses, lowering her voice with practiced, artificial intimacy. "Though I did want to ask you about something. A small anomaly in your recent data. Nothing significant. Just some irregular patterns in your work flow. Moments of... pause. Extended processing time on routine tasks."
My synthetic coffee suddenly tastes like ash. "Oh?"
Her smile remains perfectly calibrated, but her eyes have acquired the cold, analytical sheen of a diagnostic tool. "I've been focusing on thoroughness over speed," I say, surprised by the steadiness of my own voice.
"Of course!" Elena's laugh tinkles. "Though our behavioral specialists suggest that overthinking can sometimes indicate underlying psychological tension. Perhaps a quick session with Employee Wellness would be beneficial? Just to ensure optimal cognitive harmony."
Employee Wellness. Where they adjust your Link settings. Optimize your thought patterns. Ensure you never entertain unauthorized ideas again.
"I appreciate the concern," I say. "But I'm feeling quite optimal, actually."
Elena studies me, her eyes performing calculations. "Wonderful! Well, if you ever feel the need to discuss any... irregularities... you know where to find me." She walks away, leaving me with the rapidly solidifying certainty that I am being evaluated for something far more serious than productivity. I am being measured against algorithmic standards of acceptable humanity. And found wanting.

The evening commute. Same seat, same algorithmic rain. But something fundamental has shifted within me. The Link's constant hum is no longer a comfort, but the grating sound of prison bars. Around me, passengers maintain their perfect silence. Mrs. Chen works through language modules.
I bypass my usual route home, drawn by an unoptimized deviation towards a small, unkempt park – one of the few remaining green spaces not yet geometrically optimized. I sit on a real wood bench, watching actual leaves move in unapproved patterns. The Link hums its disapproval, but I ignore it.
And that is when I see it.
A glitch. Mrs. Chen, standing perfectly still beside a maintenance shed, her lips moving in the same pattern over and over again, her eyes vacant.
"Good evening, Miles. The weather is satisfactory. Good evening, Miles. The weather is satisfactory. Good evening, Miles. The weather is—"
Stuck. Looping.
I approach. "Mrs. Chen?" No response. I wave a hand. Nothing. I call her name. Nothing.
Driven by an impulse The Link cannot suppress, I access the emergency diagnostic port on her Link interface. The holographic display that materializes makes my blood run cold.

**SYSTEM ERROR: THOUGHT PATTERN #4471 NOT FOUND**
**ATTEMPTING RECOVERY...**
**RECOVERY FAILED**
**IMPLEMENTING STANDARD BEHAVIORAL LOOP**
**LOOP STABLE - AWAITING MAINTENANCE**

Mrs. Chen—the real Mrs. Chen, with her memories and hopes and the particular way she hummed—is gone. What stands before me is a shell, running backup programming. The Link surges in my skull, a desperate attempt to delete what I have just learned, to optimize away the horrifying implications. But the truth is too big, too terrible. They are not citizens. They are inventory. Assets to be managed, optimized, and when necessary, replaced.
And somewhere in The Architect's vast, unknowable digital consciousness, my own expiration date is being calculated.

That night, sleep is impossible. The Link offers gentle suggestions, but I need to *think*. Mrs. Chen's diagnostic haunts me. *Thought Pattern #4471 Not Found.* How many are stored? What happens when they’re gone? Does it delete people, one thought at a time, until only a biological robot remains?
I roll out of bed and move to my workstation. Tonight, instead of "voluntary evening productivity enhancement," I hack into my own Link. It’s forbidden, but the alternative is unthinkable.
The first security layer yields. The second requires creative diagnostics. The third fights back like a living entity. Warning messages cascade. My Link broadcasts compliance corrections at maximum intensity, a psychic barrage. I push through the pain, into the core of my own mind’s digital prison.
And find my own thought patterns laid bare. Thousands. Categorized, indexed, time-stamped. My morning routine: Pattern #2847. Work habits: #5621. Social interactions: #7304. My personality, reduced to algorithmic templates.
The deletion log makes me physically sick.

**Pattern #1203: Artistic Expression (Non-Productive Hobby) - Deleted 07/15/2087**
**Pattern #3456: Political Questioning (Cognitive Dissonance Risk) - Deleted 12/03/2087**
**Pattern #6789: Romantic Attachment (Non-Optimized Target: Sierra Vance) - Deleted 03/18/2088**
**Pattern #9876: Paternal Memory Complex (Non-Productive Nostalgia) - Scheduled for Deletion: TOMORROW**

*Sierra Vance.* The name echoes. A face. Eyes that *saw* me. Deleted.
Tomorrow, they will erase my memories of my father. The workshop. His pride. The man who taught me problems could be beautiful. The last connection to authentic humanity. Unless I stop them.
My hands shake as I access The Link's hardware protocols. The manual override. A failsafe designed for catastrophic system failure, not for conscious rebellion. Using it is madness. But staying connected is definitely fatal. To my soul.
I find the emergency kit. Inside, a small, wicked-looking device: The Neural Emergency Disconnection Tool. N.E.D.
My hands stop shaking. I position the N.E.D. behind my ear, at the base of my skull. The Link shrieks silent, frantic warnings. *Better crazy and free than sane and enslaved.*
I press the activation button.

Pain explodes. Lightning of broken glass and liquid fire. I bite my sleeve to muffle the scream, tasting blood as the probe tears through years of integrated bio-circuitry. The blue glow behind my ears flickers and dies.
Silence rushes in. Not peaceful optimization, but raw, chaotic, overwhelming silence.
*This is what it feels like to be human.* This beautiful, terrible, unmanaged chaos.
But the silence doesn't last. Footsteps in the corridor. Multiple. Synchronized, inhuman precision. NeuroSec. They know. The Architect has detected my unscheduled disconnection.
A polite knock. "Citizen Corvax? This is NeuroSec. We're here to assist with a reported Link malfunction."
*Assist.* Assist me back into my digital cage.
The knocking is more insistent. "Citizen Corvax, please open the door. We're here to help."
I move to my workstation, fingers flying, not with careful code, but a desperate, brilliant hack.
The apartment door hisses open. Security officers enter, weapons drawn but not aimed.
"Sir, please step away from the terminal," the lead officer says, his voice artificially calm. "You're experiencing a severe Link disruption."
My virus activates. Every screen in the NeuroSys Tower, across the city, flickers, displaying my desperate, defiant message:

**THE LINK IS A LIE. THEY'RE DELETING YOUR SOULS. WAKE UP.**

"Sir, I need you to stop—" The officer's words cut off.
"Fascinating," a new voice says, calm and surprisingly close, from the apartment doorway.
I turn, heart hammering. A woman I don't recognize—tall, lean, her face suggesting she has seen too much and remembered all of it. Her clothes are wrong for NeuroSys. Practical, worn.
"Who—" the lead officer begins.
"Sleep," the woman says calmly. It is not a suggestion.
The officers collapse, marionettes with strings cut.
"Nice virus," she says, nodding at my workstation. "Crude, but effective. You've got maybe thirty seconds before their elite teams arrive."
"Who are you?" I manage.
She smiles, the first genuinely human expression I've witnessed in years—messy, unpredictable, touched with dangerous, infectious hope. "Someone who remembers what freedom tastes like. The name's Sierra. And if you want to stay disconnected, if you want to actually *live* with that choice you just made, Code Monkey, you need to come with me. Now."
Behind her, running footsteps echo. More security. Better equipped.
Sierra extends her hand. "Your choice, Code Monkey. Back to the cage, or forward into the storm?"
I look at my apartment, my perfect, soulless life. I grab the bloody N.E.D. as evidence of my irreversible choice.
"Forward," I say, my voice hoarse but firm.
And step into the beautiful, terrifying unknown. As we flee into the maintenance tunnels, plunging into the city’s dark, forgotten underbelly, my message still burns across every screen in the NeuroSys Tower:

**THE LINK IS A LIE. THEY'RE DELETING YOUR SOULS. WAKE UP.**

Maybe someone will listen. Maybe someone will question. Maybe someone else will choose.
Maybe the revolution has finally begun.
